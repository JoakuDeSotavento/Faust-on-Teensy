TITLE: **Making Faust run on Hardware - Building a simple prototype Poly Synth with Faust DSP, Arduino, Teensy 4.0, and Modular**

SUMMARY: Arduino has always been a powerful platform to create hardware prototypes at an incredible pace. However, due to MCU speed and memory constraints, running real-time DSP code has been a challenge that required heavily optimized code. Teensy 4.0 and Faust finally deliver a platform to easily achieve great-sounding, versatile sound synthesis that allows for prototyping DSP based module ideas without the need of designing a dedicated PCB for every project. In our talk, we guide you through building a simple prototype Poly Synth with Faust DSP, Arduino, Teensy 4.0, and Modular.
